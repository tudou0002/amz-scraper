It is exactly the deminsions listed in the description.

The only improvements I could suggest is to maybe (1) have the max setting a little bit higher - I don't think I could read a standard book using this light (but then again this is not what I set out to do), (2) have the on/off button faintly illuminated - the single touch brings up a night light but if you wanted the full light you have to click the exact button.

I like it it has a full array of lighting color / temp from white all the way back to tradition yellow. The flex tube to adjust the angle of your light is pretty sturdy, doesn't feel flimsy at all. Seems like this is going to last a long time. The Piano face panel and base is beautiful but you know....like all piano surface, even if you use a duster will leave scratch marks or marks on it....emm but that's the nature of the material. I dont' mind the shinny Piano surface at all. Simple functions, nothing fancy, it's all about the color temp light and brightness which is all I need when I work on my hobby stuff. If you need super bright and long range lighting, you need to buy expensive more heavy duty LED work lights / tubes that mount to your work bench. I am just using a long Ikea Desk with 2 of these lights and work for me. Different people have different needs, if you need bright lighting through out all areas of your hobby / work desk / bench, you will need to invest something more appropriate. But I don't think this will be disappointing for anyone that needs a ready light, more than enough. Anyway, it's a lamp, 360 lumen or something.... if it's bright enough for you, then you won't be disappointed. Beautiful touch panel for brightness adjustmen (like sweeping your finger on your Mac book to increase volume) Buttons responses is very accurate and no delays.

B07ZYZG62H," 'I have been using my old desk lamp for over 20 years. It still works, but it heats up way too fast and the plug is HUGE!'I have been wanting a light foldable lamp like this for a while. There are so many brands and so many variations out there that it has been very tough for me to make the decision. For me, the things that I was looking for were: height of lamp so it does not hit my large monitor, flexibility of adjustments (such as angling the light to hit off the wall), brightness and cost.'Now, in terms of height, I highly suggest you to look into the dimension of the lamps. Because some lamps are way shorter than they look in pictures. This lamp is on the taller end, which is perfect and goes over my monitor. This way, I can work on my papers in front of me while the lamp hovers over my monitor instead of beside it.'bThis must be one of the most flexible desk lamps I've seen that is not wire framed. It literally have some sort of adjustable option at each joint. At the base and the arm, you can turn the lamp 120 degrees left and right. For me, this is useful because I can turn the lamp when I work at my desk or turn it back when I read in bed. Just right above that joint, there is another joint that lets you bend the overall lamp arm forward or backwards. At the top, between the longer arm of the lamp and light arm, there is also a joint there that lets you fold the lamp in half when not used or higher when you need more light in the room. Now, my favourite joint is slightly above this where it lets you turn the light arm 180 degrees to the left or the right. I use this often depending on what I am working on. If I am working on notes in a notebook, I would turn the light to shine directly downwards. If I am on the computer, I like to turn the light towards the wall and have the light bounce back to prevent glare. Like I said, this lamp is super adjustable.bThe brightness options surprised me. My old lamp had one setting - on or off. This lamp has 5 shades of light settings (from bright white to yellow), and in each shade, there's 12 levels of brightness setting. I love this because I like white light for some activities while I prefer a warmer yellow tone when I read. This is just super versatile. Also, I had it on for hours and it was still cool to the touch! Super impressed.bCost wise, lamps have been on a wide range of pricing. I got this during a Lightning Deal, so it was a good deal for me. Even if it wasn't on a lightning deal, I think I would have still get this.I also want to mention that it is super lightweight. The plug is a medium sized plug. There is a USB port behind the lamp which you can plug a cable in to charge your phone on your desk. It does not have a wireless charger.

B07T674Z3D," 'This is a great lamp that is eye catching, priced right, and a conversation piece as well. I put it together in minutes and had no issue with any of the machined parts not fitting/screwing together properly. The instructions are not great, but you don t really need them to put this item together, it is pretty straight forward. The only issue I had was keeping the bars that form the atom from rotating. While not in the instructions, I found small screws on the sides that you can hand tighten to lock the bars in place once you get the shape you want. Once I did this, the lamp looked great. I paired it with the following Edison bulb (https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B07QC556HB/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and I was very pleased with the overall industrial look of the lamp. In fact, I liked these lights so much, I put one in another vintage lamp from the same company (https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B07ZYZFMWB) and looks just as good. My only issue or complaint is that the lamp is very bright, even with the 2300k/40w equivalent bulb. Since there is no shade, you need to be mindful of its placement. In order to change the mood or brightness of the light, an included dimmer on the cord would be nice in a future update. Even with this omission, I don t feel it is fair to take off a full star, so I am giving it a 5-star rating. In order to get more control over the brightness, I decided to pair it with this dimmer switch (https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B07GFQ8PBV/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and this combination makes it nearly perfect.'Recommended!'Good luck with your decision/purchase.'

B07T674Z3D," 'First off, I LIKE this lamp. I like how it looks, and once I got an Edison-style bulb for it, I like using it as an accent piece. But as an actual, functional light it is not very useful. I will explain why in a minute.'bAssembly takes literally 60 seconds, and is so simple the included instructions are not required, so I'll skip over that.The lamp does not come with a bulb, and for the price I think one should be included, and a nice Edison style incandescent bulb, because if you use a standard incandescent or LED bulb, even a low wattage one, it will be too bright because there is no shade. That is what makes this not particularly great as a lamp per se.'bIt has a great sort of industrial or even steampunk aesthetic though, and so an Edison style bulb works perfectly! They are dim enough that you won't be blinded by the lack of a shade, and the style compliments the steampunk-y aesthetic, making it great as a conversation piece or decoration.I wish there were an on/off switch on the body or base of the lamp instead of being in line on the power cable. That just makes it difficult to turn on and off in place. Those are OK for standing lamps, but not so much for table lamps. I solved this problem by putting it on top of a book case.'Overall, when paired with an Edison bulb, I like this lamp. But it IS pricey, and it is only really good for its look, and not its practical use. If you are shooting for a specific aesthetic in a room and this matches, great! Go for it. But I feel there is better value elsewhere in every other case.'

B07T674Z3D," 'I love the look of this lamp!'bIt's a standard desk top height with a nicely weighted base to keep it stable. It comes in parts to screw together with the electrical cord threaded through them. Other reviewers said that it went together very easily, and generally I would agree, but I somehow didn't match the threads right when I first connected the body to the top and had a terrible time separating them again, because the whole thing spun rather than staying still. I did finally get them apart but it took several attempts, so be sure to get it perfectly lined up the first time!The colour is a mottled brown/black, very industrial looking. The atom-like top comes flat and you rotate each layer to the position you like and then tighten the screws that attach them together. A small bag with a couple of screws was also in the box but with no explanation of what they are for. Perhaps spares for the lamp top?'bThe base arrives exposed, with a thin foam cover that you peel and stick once you assemble the lamp. It's a little flimsy and not necessary other than for keeping dust out. It wouldn't protect the inside if it were poked or somehow damaged.bI use a 40 watt smoked lightbulb to complete the industrial look. I recommend an opaque lightbulb since the bulb is exposed and will bother your eyes if it's in your line of vision.A pair of these for $99 or $129 in a furniture store would be very reasonable for the quality.

I've not used the USB feature so I can't comment on that. The only downside is the power button. In the last 2 weeks the power button has become quirky and unreliable. Sometimes the lamp will turn on right away. Other times, I must repeatedly press the power button to get the lamp to turn on. The same goes for turning it off. The lamp does not always turn off when I press the power button for 2 secs. On occasion, it does not turn off at all, and I must unplug the adapter. This is totally unacceptable, not to mention disappointing and worrisome. I've sent an e-mail to Sunvalleytek and to Taotronics but have yet to receive a reply. Consequently I must give this item a poor rating. ","Reviewed in Canada on December 12, 2018",2,BVC, 'Nice lamp but the on/off power button has become quirky and unreliable.'

Motion detection has been working fine for us...even when there is some light in the room; however, we have the sensor pointed away from the light.The light has 12 LEDs, 6 are Warm White, 6 are Cool White.'bThe light has a hanging hook which is great for outdoor use or camping. The hook folds down, out of the way when it's not needed. My hubby gets up several times a night so we\'re using the Motion Sensing Mode. The lampshade is about 6 1/2 in diameter at its widest. The light is too large to sit on our windowsill, so we have it on a dresser.'Although, I can read for about 20 minutes using the Daylight Mode, I need to be fairly close to the light.'bIf your light doesn't seem to be functioning properly one of the possibilities could be that the batteries need to be replaced. Review sample provided.bThis is a nice portable, battery operated light. It can be set to for Cool White or Warm White Light or Motion Sensing Cool White. The hanging hook, which can be folded out of the way, is useful for camping, or carrying the light like a lantern, etc. It's not the best reading light, but I can read for about 20 minutes if I'm close to the light.

B06XBDG88S," 'Free product provided for evaluation and review.'bThis is a little white lamp, that looks like a lamp. The 'shade' however has a loop on it, so this item can be hung up like a lantern if you wish.-plastic construction'-12 LEDs total which can be turned from high (bright enough for reading) or Low as a night light'- takes C cell batteries, which are easy to change'-has a motion detector function'bThe motion detector function works well, which makes this a nice light for a hall. In the bedroom, I find that it comes on when I turn over, and it wakes me up, so I turn the lamp around before I go to bed and cover the motion detector with a scarf. I tried moving it up higher but it still came on. It might be better if it were pointed away from the bed, but in my small bedroom I didn't have any luck unless I turned it away from me and covered it up. Also, the cats were setting it off.In a hall though, it is perfect- it lightens the hall as we get up at night, and has kept us from turning our bedroom lights on waking anyone else who is sleeping in the room. It provides plenty of light for navigation, or to get an item from the hall shelves.'bIt is light weight, with the bulk of the weight coming from the batteries as much as anything else. When mine was in the bedroom, a cat knocked it over more than once and it hit the floor. It didn't break- being a supple, flexible plastic it took the fall fine. The batteries did get knocked out once, and they just had to be replaced, and the item was as good as new. They nearly knocked it to the floor a few other times, so I do recommend putting it someplace cats usually don't jump to, or move around on. They can EASILY knock this off with one swipe of a paw or when stretching out.

That is the result of Chloe's clever use of resin instead of lead to join all the glass pieces.

B0070PBVWO," 'I wanted to wait a good long while before writing a review for this lamp, so that it would be as fair as possible to the product, but also for anyone who may be reading this.'bI also wanted to mention that I did look at many of these Tiffany style lamps on Amazon before deciding on this particular one. I really like the design of this lamp and the overall look of it in my room. I do think finding a lamp that's going to be most suited for you and your personal needs is one of the most important factors of all.bWhen I stumbled upon this particular lamp, I knew right away this was the one for me. I also noticed the amount of positive reviews it received from other people, and it's not difficult to see why. It really is stunning, and Amazon photos really don't do it any justice at all.bSome of the main features of the lamp that I really like include: the on/off switch located on the cord. Some people may not like this feature or may feel it's even odd, but I personally think it's a much better option than pull-chain switches which can sometimes be problematic. I also like the amount of light it gives off. My lamp sits on top of a large old wooden desk in a corner of a room that doesn't always get the best light at night, and this lamp is perfect for lighting it up. I also like how easy it is to keep the lamp clean. Some lamps are impossible to clean because of fabrics used on the shade, but with this lamp you really only need to give it a quick wipe and that's it. The lamp also has a nice amount of weight to it, so you don't have to worry about it being tippy or easily knocked over. One suggestion I will make to anyone considering buying this, or any other Tiffany style lamp, is that in the description it lists places where the lamp can be used. One of these suggestions is a kids room. Depending on the age of the child (children) I would advise using your own personal judgement and discretion on this one.bAs stated, there is very light assembly for this lamp when you get it, but it's so easy and straight forward. All you need to do is fit the harp sleeves into the harp bottom, put the shade on and screw in the finial on top. Simple! Other reviewers of this lamp have commented that it comes with a bulb, and I can confirm this to be true. It does include one light bulb.bI've had my lamp for 6 months now, and I'm still just as happy with it. I really don't have one negative thing to say about it. Even the price is decent for what it offers. I highly recommend this particular lamp to anyone who's considering purchasing it. You won't be disappointed.

The crystals (which appear to just be angular pieces of clear but reflective plastic) are held in place by a series of wires, so while it looks like a pretty nice lamp from across the room, when you look at it close up (like if it\'s on your bedside table) I find it looks kind of weird. Not necessarily bad, just strange and not quite what I expected it to look like up close.

Well, it is made out of metal and the base and arm are great. However the lamp\'s head itself feels really cheaply made. When arrived, the bulb was not centered inside the lampshade but luckily the socket is so cheaply mounted that it\'s very easy to bend it back. The light switch on top is easy to turn but the its feel and quality of the plastic just doesn\'t inspire any confidence that it\'ll last. The lampshade is metal but quite thin but wouldn\'t be an issue if it wasn\'t for everything else. It\'s just such a shame given that the base and arm are pretty good.'bSpeaking of the base and arm though, they have their own problem: on architect's lamps usually both the lower and upper arms are free to move, giving it good reach. On this model though, for whatever reason, Globe decided to lock the bottom arm in place, so it will swivel but won't move back and forth. My guess they were worried about the lamp tipping over because the base isn't heavy enough. Unfortunately, this means that the lamp has a poor reach. You can use it on your desk to write in a notebook, but that's pretty much it. My wife wanted to use this lamp over her sewing machine and this lamp just wouldn't reach.Now, there is a screw and a little bolt at the base of the arm that I have removed, at my own risk, to free the lower arm and allow it to swivel as architect lamps should. It is concerning though that the manufacturer has disabled this feature from the factory though.'bAll-in-all, it'll do the job now that the bottom arm is free to move, but it's still just okay - far from great.

B07NNQDQ48," 'The lamp base is solid and heavy. The springs are dark coloured so they look good. The lamp shade attaches a bit precariously. The design and photos may give the impression that the lamp arm will flex up/down at the lower arm connection to the base. That joint and angle are fixed and the lower two springs are, unfortunately, simply decorative. Hence with the back-angled lower arm (mine appears to be even more angled than the photos), the purported height/length and the potential reach of the lamp is significantly less than it appears. It can still function adequately as a desk light, but if you were counting on an extended reach application, this is not going to perform like a true architect s lamp.'

B07PT8CZ3K," 'WHAT I LIKE:' Excellent build quality - the arms are made mostly of metal, as is much of the base - it really feels like a high quality lamp' Very good range of brightness and colour temperature settings, and good granularity of in-between settings. Goes from very dim to very bright - not as bright as a proper overhead light, but bright enough to light up a small to medium sized room well enough to see things relatively clearly. In terms of colour temperature, it goes from very cold (bluish) to very warm (orange). I use it towards the warmer end at night when I m trying to get to sleep, and towards the colder end during the day to maintain a comfortable work or awake environment. As with brightness, there s a good range of settings between the two extremes.' The light is well diffused.' The small night light on the side of the lamp comes in very handy. It s very dim, but is great for when you need to get up to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night, for example. Note the night light only has one brightness (quite dim) and one colour temperature (quite orange) setting.' The arm is extremely versatile, allowing you to bend and rotate it into pretty much any position. The base can swivel a full 180 degrees. The lamp itself can also swivel 180 degrees, allowing you to aim it down or to either side (or anything in between). You can t aim it straight up, but hey still pretty darn good. One trick I use is to aim shine right against a lightly coloured (preferably white) wall. Bouncing the light off the wall diffuses it even more than the built-in diffuser, flooding the room with a nice, soft light.' Touch-sensitive buttons look really slick, especially when backlit.' The base of the lamp has a relatively small footprint, so it doesn t take up too much space on the desk (but still gives the lamp good stability).' The maximum height of the lamp is very good for a desk lamp - allows you to get good height above the desk, making for a large illuminated area and also keeping the lamp from getting in the way of other objects on the desk.' The power cord length is 6 ft long, giving you good flexibility in terms of where you can place the lamp relative to a wall outlet. The adapter that plugs directly into the wall is a bit large and might take up more than one outlet, but if you aim it in the right direction or place it at the end of a power bar, this shouldn t be a big deal.' LEDs (in general) save on power and last a very long time (10-20 years, supposedly).' The 2A USB charging port on the side comes in very handy. I plug my phone into it every night to ensure it s charged and ready to go in the morning. Doing this, I can also use one less outlet that I would have otherwise used to charge the phone - this mitigates the size of the wall plug to some extent (see above). Also, many other lamps I looked at were only 1A, which doesn t efficiently charge tablets and many modern phones (especially larger ones).'THINGS THAT COULD BE IMPROVED:' While the touch-sensitive buttons are backlit making it possible to see them in the dark, they are quite bright, which could be annoying if you like a totally dark room. That said, my wife is quite sensitive to light while she s sleeping, and hasn t been bothered by this.' While the touch-sensitive buttons look really nice, they don t have any tactile feel to them. So even with them being backlit, when your hand is poking around in the dark to find the power button, it can be a bit tricky to find the button sometimes.' The only way to turn on the light is by pressing the power button. So when turning it on, it will be the brightness you had it at when last turning it off. This can be an issue if you had it set really bright when turning it off, but don t want to have an abrupt bright light when turning it back on. It would be better if you could also turn it on by pressing the desired brightness button, and have it turn on at that brightness.' It would be slightly better if the power cable connector was right angled, or connected to the side of the lamp instead of the back. As it is, it sticks straight out of the back, so I can t push the base quite as close to the wall as I d like (see attached photo).'OVERALL IMPRESSION: I really love this lamp. It does have some room for improvement, but the issues I ve mentioned are not big deals, and don t detract much from the awesomeness of this lamp. It may sound weird, but I actually *enjoy* using this lamp. I would highly recommend it!' ","Reviewed in Canada on October 29, 2017",5,Josh Levinson, 'Excellent and extremely versatile desk lamp'

The symbology for controls is a bit confusing particularly the colour temperature adjustment, perhaps a focus group for more universally recognizable symbols would be a good idea. 2.The illuminated controls are a bit bright for someone like me who likes a dark room they give off a bit too much light enough to cast shadows in a dark room. 3.

Every other adjustment (lowering angle of the longest arm, lowering or raising the angle of the LED-arm) can be done single-handedly. But I can t really see how it would be designed otherwise without making it very heavy, or risk drooping. 2) The night-light component is not the most elegant looking (clear plastic cap). It s decent quality though. 3) I wish the temperatures/brightness was even more adjustable (rather than 5 temp settings and 6 brightness settings). 4) I wish the USB port was much higher voltage for fast-charging, or USB-C (for the latest devices). 5) the LED bar is by no means small but I wish it was extra long.'Other than those things, it s really a great lamp.

B07Y9J8KQN," 'I received the lamp today and this is just my first impression. My very first thought was that its much lighter than expected, so while taking the plastic off I was a bit surprised how much more like plastic it felt. The bottom is heavier, so there is no worries of it just tilting and falling aside or such. The overall design is pretty neat and glossy (but attracts dust easily), its a good size and the light covers the major area of my huge desk. The touch sensor works great, one little touch and it turns on and off easily and changes the brightness so effortless. This was my favorite (and obviously the) main part: the different light options. Sure, I looked at the description and read the reviews (and saw pictures) but to have it in front of you is a different experience. I was pleased at the amount of different light levels (which is why I chose this over another one I might have gotten). I am an artist so I needed a white desk light but I absolutely love that I can change it into warm light and therefore increase it into a deeper orange-red. Oh and btw, it does this too and I love it: Adjustable arm, rotating base, and swiveling lamp head for perfect positioning and lighting angle.'I am really happy with purchase!'

The unit is good looking.'bA couple of small criticisms: The main vertical neck of the lamp only swivels about 15-20 degrees. If you want the light to be perpendicular to your seating position (as most desk lamps are), you have to turn the base about 45 degrees which takes up more desk space and looks a little weird. The built in USB charger is just 1 amp (strange coming from Anker who makes the best chargers on the market) and the plug is located on the back of the unit in the most awkward spot possible. I didn't buy it for the charger but this is a missed opportunity.

B07Y9J8KQN," 'bThis product was delivered very quickly! I ordered it over the weekend and by Monday morning it was at my door! It came nicely wrapped and arrived in perfect condition. I was really surprised by this lamp! Originally I was thinking of it just for a desk light; however when I plugged it in it has multiple features! The lamp can bend quite a bit ways up and fold down too (great for moving). It has a sturdy solid base and you can swivel the light stem of the light enabling you to focus the light where you need it. As Well, and this in the best part, it has multiple light settings! It has dofgerent colour too, ranging from a soft warm light to a very bright white light. As well, it has multiple brightness levels for each of the light settings so you can customize the light to what your doing. For example, when I'm working on crafts and painting, I need to see the true colour of the paint but having a warm light changes the hue of the paint; how the eye sees it. So for these cases I would use the bright white so it shows the true hue and shade of the paint colour. Also good when you need a bright light to see things more clearer, like say a sliver in the skin or something. Next time that happened to my kids I'll be bringing them over to this lamp so I can actually see it! I also like the warm light as well. It's great for working on the laptop or for reading, instead of having a harsh light. Great for reading in bed too as the soft light won't wake you up light a bright light would. It also has a timer feature and a nightlight feature - which I didn't realize. When the light is turned off there's a small little yellow light that shows you where the night light button is - handy! The lamp has sleek modern, space saving design which would fit in any decor. In fact, given all the great features as well as the night light, I'll likely get another one for my son's room so he can have a light on his desk but also a night light in his room!

Didn\'t buy it since I don\'t need wireless charging and preferred the layout of the existing model - just personal preference.'bOne thing I will say is that while one of the product picture shows someone reading using the night-lite function, personally wouldn't recommend this lamp if that's something really important. Personally wouldn't try reading using it - it's a good night lite but not for reading IMHO. Doesn't change my rating since it's not an important feature for me.

B07V7TJRVM," 'I have been looking for bedside lamps since my old IKEA lamps had done their time. I went to several stores and checked out different options but nothing really seem to appeal to me. I stumbled upon these lamps on Amazon and was initially little hesitant given their appearance but decided to give them a try nevertheless. The lamps came in record time shipping was next day, the packaging was of a very high-quality and the lamps had some pretty decent heft to them.'Setting them up is pretty basic you simply remove the plastic wrap charge them using the included micro USB cables and you are good to go. They have two functions with three flush marked buttons on the base, the first button to the left controls your Bluetooth, holding it down will put you into pairing mode and once you go into your device and search for it it should show up on your Bluetooth device list. Simply click pair and you are good to go. You can send any audio from your device to the lamp and it will play from the speaker which is located at the top of the lamp. The sound coming out of the speaker is pretty decent given the size of the lamp I was pleasantly surprised. Odd thing to note is that the lamp asked for permission to sync my phone contacts which I didn t understand as it cannot be used for hands-free calling.'The second flush button controls the key function which is the light, a gentle tap on the button will cycle the lamp through different brightness levels and colours. There are four brightness settings, they range from very dim to fairly bright, the next tap will get you to the colour Red (it is important to note that the brightness cannot be adjusted when you were on the different colours). The final tap will get you to a mode that cycles through different colours in a slow controlled motion. It actually looks very nice and the colour change is gradual. To turn off the lamp you simply long press the second button at any point in the different brightness or colour modes and it will turn off, to turn it back on simply press the same button and it will default to the dim setting.' The final button to the right controls the timer, tapping it once will turn on the timer for 10 minutes and you can go up to 120 minutes. Long pressing the button will cancel the timer. The best thing about this feature is that there are audible responses to let you know what time you have selected and when you cancel the timer.' There is a manual included for your reference if needed, overall I must say I was initially not sold on them but as I have gotten to use the lamps I find that they are growing on me and I now like the ease of use and the different functions. One concern for me initially was not being able to simply touch the lamp to turn it on, however I have since discovered that swiping your fingers (3) on the base at the front will either simply turn on the light at it s dimmest setting or display three lights that correspond to each of the flush buttons discussed earlier and at that point you can choose the option that you want, so even in the dark it would be easy to turn on the light by tapping the button if the swiping action did not turn on the lamp.'I have not use these outside the bedroom but there s absolutely no reason why you could not take them into different rooms depending on what you need, they have a built-in battery and are portable. Be careful not to use them in wet conditions as this is not encouraged. Overall I would highly recommend these especially at the price point they are listed for.'

Very little plastic is used in the construction, and the entire lamp assembly feels heavy duty and weighty. In the box, you will find the lamp safely secured in packaging foam, along with an AC adapter, user guide/warranty paper, and a microfiber cleaning cloth (for the shiny bits of the lamp).'The lamp itself is pretty easy to use. Top row is brightness adjustment with 6 levels of brightness to choose from. In the bottom row, you\'ve got a power button that is lit (but not overly bright) even when the lamp is off. So you\'ll have no problems turning this lamp on in the dark. There\'s a coffee button for making the white balance more yellow and a book button for making the white balance more blue. With 5 white balance settings in total, you\'d use the coffee and book buttons to cycle up and down the settings. Next to that is a favorite button, which is used to save your most used light setting. Set your lamp to the white balance and brightness you want, and you hold that button for 2 seconds for your settings to get saved into memory. Whenever you press that button, it will automatically go back to that setting. After that, a non adjustable timer button. Press it and the lamp will turn off in 60 minutes. Press it again and it will cancel the timer function. Lastly, a night light button. This turns off the main lamp and turns on the small dim light on the side of the lamp.'At the left side of the base, there is a conveniently placed USB charging port. Goodbye to reaching down below the desk to plug in a charger. With 2.4A of charging power, it manages to charge my S8 with ease.'bThe one small negative to what is otherwise an excellent lamp is the really stiff swivel mechanism, as everyone else has mentioned. Being a desk lamp with swivel capability, you'd think they'd make the swivel part more effortless like 99% of lamps out in the market. In order to swivel the lamp to the direction you want, you'd have to hold the base firmly with one hand, and move (with a bit of strength) the arm using your other hand. Yea.. it's a task requiring both hands just to swivel your lamp. Quite an annoyance when you only need to move the lamp a little bit.

No big deal because you will stretch it - it stretches quite easily with no tears - as you install it on the lamp. The wrinkles will disappear quickly while stretched, but what remains is just a plain, white lamp paper shade. When NOT lit, it's a bit spartan and kind of boring in my book. I suppose a minimalist would like this. I think I would have preferred an oriental design, or any other tasteful design, to go with an oriental lamp like this, to give it the extra oomph. As it stands, this is still an outstanding value for a floor lamp and I'm glad I have it.

No searching for the switch under the shade. Has a very contemporary look. The color changes can be changed to match the color scheme of your room. Easy to dust.

She had first choice and wanted this light over the Aukey for the RGB. The pro's about this light are the RGB bulb that is included, lower cost, and smaller size. I would say the only minor con is the light switches between three levels rather than dims; however, the levels do work well for reading or brightening up the room when needed (e.g., practicing guitar) so this is minor and some might see it as a plus since it is quicker to change output. So far so good and I would certainly buy another one. ","Reviewed in Canada on October 30, 2019",4,dadama, 'Great bedside light.'

They were very responsive to my concerns and contacted me immediately.'I have now had it for 4 months, and it has been a bit finicky from the beginning.

It only plays the right channel of stereo, which is bizarre.'bOne more strange thing. There is a small LED that is blue if something is charging and amber if there isnt. When it's blue, it is BRIGHT, like fill the room bright.

B01AXXXV36," 'bTo begin with, the lamp was nicely packaged in the box with all surfaces covered by plastic wrap. The lamp looks very elegant on a desk, more so when matched to a dark coloured surface. The glossy plastic makes dust quite visible when lamp is turned on. (A quick sweep would resolve that easily.) I don't notice fingerprints as I keep my hands clean and I don't move/adjust my lamp often if ever. It is very lightweight and most of the weight is in the base to keep it nice and sturdy. The swivelling head of the lamp was a key feature I was looking for. The arm connecting to the base doesn't rotate very much so you might need to move the entire lamp in certain scenarios. All the touch controls are very responsive and does what you expect.bI personally don't use the USB port so I can't comment on it but its nicely hidden in the back. The max brightness is brighter than I expected and lights up my entire desk evenly under complete darkness. The warmth of the light can be changed and has one to fit every situation. LEDs maintain a low temperature even if turned on for long periods of time (unlike incandescence bulbs) and reduces the risk of burning yourself. When the lamp is off, there is a pixel sized orange light illuminated which turns on the 'Night Light' when pressed. I found this feature too dim to be useful for anything other than helping me find the power button. The timer function may be handy for those who sleep with lights on. The lamp maintains the last settings you chose which should be a standard in every lamp.Overall I highly recommend this lamp to anyone looking for a simple desk lamp.'

The surface is smooth, so it's very difficult to find the buttons in the dark, so the night mode will illuminate it enough to see the buttons to press when you are in a dark room.bOverall, it's a great energy saving alternative to a traditional desk lamp.

Easy packaging and even easier to install! It has got 5 light versions/modes. Each light mode can be increased or decreased in brightness. The timer button turns off the lamp in 1 hour. The moon icon is basically for night light. The lamp remembers the last light version/mode and the brightness intensity, which is great! The light mode ranges to bright white to yellowish hue.bThe only (very minor) con is that when the lamp is off, the moon icon is lit, which is great. But when I need to turn on the lamp, in the dark, I first have to turn on the night light, locate the power button (second one in product pic) and then press it to get the lamp to turn on. So, just an extra minor step involved to turn the lamp on when it's really dark. But this is very minor.bOverall, I am extremely happy with this lamp and I will say that it's probably one of the best ones I've ever bought.

B00APAQSP6," 'bThis is a good lamp contextualised specifically by the price; it is the price that matters in this review. If it was over 36 bucks I wouldn't have given it 4 stars as it is only a good lamp insofar as it is priced well. The three setting of normal light are good enough for a bedside light, although it could be a bit more warm in the colour department which is my bias, and the RGS feature is decent enough. The controls for the regular light are perfectly fine where you just touch it to cycle between the three settings although the RGB feature is implemented in a way that you have to let it cycle through the colours every time you want to set a certain colour which can be a PITA if you don't regularly use red (which just happens to be the colour I bought it for) as it stars from there and slowly goes through all the colours until you tap it to stop on a colour.So, the build quality is objectively good. The standard settings for and operation of the normal touch light are perfectly fine.. Controlling the specific colour can be a hassle as there is no direct way to a colour other than red and the colour setting only has one brightness which some people might not like.'In conclusion if you are in the market for a cheap bedside lamp with an RGB function this is probably your best choice although if you have a few more bucks to spend you might want to buy one with a remote which would allow you to go straight to specific colours and also have brightness control for the coloured lights.'bI am happy I bought this lamp as it fits my specific needs quite well but I could easily see this rated as either a 5 or a 3 for depending on what someone wants out of a lamp so consider these points before buying to see where you think you'll land.bEdit: After about a year the lamp just stopped receiving power and was rendered useless without any foul play; it had just sat on my desk. Since I registered it with Aukey when I purchased it all I had to do was send a video of the issue and my Amazon order number to get a replacement sent out to me. I didn't have to send the broken one back as I had proved it was broken while once they sent it out it only took a couple of days to get here.

The choice of warm or cool light, variable intensity, auxiliary night light and USB port provide maximum convenience and versatility. One observation, not a criticism, is that if you need a pair of lamps for either side of a double bed, they do not exactly match. On one side of the bed the auxiliary night light will be facing out and on the other side it will be facing in. A similar and slightly cheaper desk lamp from the same company, does not have the night light option and so will form a matching pair. It too has a well-earned high rating.

I don't have much use for the color spectrum on it, but bought it mainly for the purpose of having three levels of white lighting. I don't get bothered by the blue lighting of the base when it's off at night; I guess it just depends on how light a sleeper you are and how important having complete darkness in your room is to you. I have noticed that there's been a few times where the touch base hasn't responded to my attempts to cycle through the 3 levels of light to turn it off, but eventually I've been able to succeed in turning it off. Switching it over to the color spectrum and then turning it off from there worked. As others have stated, the white light (and even the colored light) is very bright, and you'll have no problem reading by it. I have a fairly large bedroom and it does a very good job of lighting up the whole room during the evening.

It's everything you want a lamp to be and even includes a 1 hour sleep timer. Heck, it even comes with a small polishing cloth!bI'm absolutely thrilled with this lamp. Sometimes you happen upon a product that is so absolutely perfect, you feel like you should buy 10 of them in case it becomes discontinued and your lamps start to break. I haven't gone that far, but believe me, this lamp will NOT disappoint you.Great for students, writers, readers.' ","Reviewed in Canada on January 13, 2017",5,A.

Would've liked to choose brightness on the color mode as well, but you can only choose one brightness on color mode.bTouch is fairly responsive, and feels like it's all made from pretty good materials.Unfortunately the dimmest is still too bright for my personal preference. I wanted to use the lamp as a dim, bedside lamp to unwind and eventually fall asleep to, but the light emitted from the lamp is overwhelming and rather a distraction.'bIf you are looking for a more dim light, this product is probably not for you.

B00APAQSP6," 'This lamp performed essentially precisely as described. I was a bit confused initially, thinking that it should come apart in order to replace a bulb but that is not the case. There is no bulb to replace and the lamp is reputed to last for several thousand hours. It\'s light and easy to operate and, I\'ll admit, lots of fun. It cycles through its rainbow of colours effectively and I like that you can stop it at a particular colour. As for claims that it emits a warm light -- this is absolutely not the case. The 3 levels of white lighting is by no means warm. It is a very cool light, veering towards the blue range of the colour spectrum rather than the red. That said, what I have done is allow the colour function to cycle and I stop it at the pale beigey/yellow spot. This provides the warm glow that I was hoping for. As for the 3 levels of white, they are all pretty bright. Again, I was hoping that the lowest level would be around the brightness of a 40-watt incandescent bulb maybe even a 25-watt. I\'d say that it is at least 60-watt strength with the next level being close to 100-watt. This (second) level is perfectly easy to read by. I find that the 3rd level is brighter than I would ever use. All-in-all, it\'s worth the money, providing an attractive lighting source and a great conversation piece.'

Maybe there\'s a quicker way but I haven\'t found it. Mostly I use the kind of amber/yellow right after the initial red so that\'s fast, but when I do want blue or purple it\'s slow to get to.

Super happy with the light. User has full control over how bright or how dim and what color you want. If you are doing something like fixing a watch or something detailed you can use the cool white at the brightest setting. If you just want to read or work on your computer then the warm white is great. I love the color change function; great for two people who have different prefernces for light. The timer feature only allows one hour, but I never knew what the timer is for in the first place.'bThe lamp itself is very nice and sleek. Came packaged very snug and safe. It's not obtrusive on your desk. You can fold it away when it isnt needed. Super simple to setup, and figure out.

Sometimes we can get it to turn on or off by just tapping a million times, and sometimes it takes leaving our finger there for a minute or two. Super frustrating when you want to turn the lamp off to go to sleep.'Very surprising as I have bought other Aukey products in the past and they work flawlessly and are great value for money.'bOur lamp has become a bit of a paperweight at this point.

Since I work in an office, I've seen what a GOOD led desk lamp looks and *feels* like, and this one is highly overpraised:- very cheap plastic for the price; it looks like it could break anytime'b- dust/fingerprint collector which is annoying since the material is a lot shiny; there's no way around this unless you put matte stickers all over itb- **second worst thing** No rotation for the top branch! Since the lamp is high on foot (too much for desktop work since you can't rotate the upper branch), its easy to get blinded if you move your head on the side or 'too low'.Since its direct light, you get glares on the stuff you are reading/working on which is *extremely* annoying even at lower brightness settings; a possibility for rotation would have help but who knows.. it must costs billions to integrate such a contraption I guess.'b- ***worst thing of all*** the lighting is awful imo.. it has as someone said a greenish/drab feel to it, which doesn't help concentration at all contrary to what they claim. The best option (and only for me) is the 'Night Mode', even for reading and working on stuff, **but the direct lighting focus make a spot instead of diffusing light uniformly.**b- and if your intention was to use it as a general lamp, you can forget it too which is not its purpose; maybe if you could rotate it could be used pointing at a wall for diffuse light, but you don't get much option with that moneybait..bI would pay 30$(can) *max* for this, and even at this price I wouldn't buy it.

B00APAQSP6," 'i got this to replace a swing arm lamp on my desk. i had gone through several and even up to $50 models i found that they were poorly constrcted and often broke. on some the springs were held by plastic pegs that break, on others the metal post that holds the lamp wasnt strong enough to support the weight of the lamp. while looking for a replacement that wouldnt break and didnt cost $100 i came across this. This item is far better than any of the swing arm desk lamps ive had before. the arm is adjustable, stays in place easily. there are many light warmth settings, so you can have it bright for doing paperwork, or put in on a soft light for watching TV or falling asleep. each of the light warmth settings has adjustable brightness as well, it has a 60 minute off timer. i also love and make great use of the USB port on the base for charging devices. The base is large, sturdy and well weighted so the lamp doesnt tip or move. the base also has a slight concave spot on it too so you could hold little screws or something without them rolling away.'This is the best desk lamp ive used, the next best would be a standard swing arm desk lamp that attaches via clamp that was all metal and lasted forever, through all kinds of abuse. i didnt realize how good i had it until i needed to replace it. If i had to complain about this lamp i would say that the base does take up valuable desk real estate, where most swing arm lamps would just clamp to the edge of the desk, but i just put the item plugged into the USB port on it, so its not completely wasted space, as well at $38 its a small price to pay for such a classy looking, functional and bright lamp.'

I can't imagine paying full price for this, because I feel like it's not even worth the price I paid. The good - it's sturdy, the clip does a good job at holding the lamp in place on my desk, the light is fairly bright, but not bright enough to light up a room. The light is good enough to light up your desk area but that's it. Now for the bad - the controls. There's no dials, no buttons, just a touch sensitive rectangle near the base of the lamp. Tap the bottom of the rectangle and it turns on. Tap the top and it'll cycle through the built in modes. Tap and hold the top to change colour temperature, or tap and hold the bottom to change brightness. The thing I hate most about the controls is that you can't just turn it up or down a little bit. If the light is halfway between max and min brightness, and I want to dim the light a bit more, I have to tap and hold until it reaches maximum brightness, then tap and hold again for it to dim the light. Same with colour temperature. Want the light a little bit more blue? You have to tap and hold until it reaches maximum yellow light, then tap and hold again for it to change to blue. Also it's nearly impossible to see where the controls are in the dark. I really feel like this lamp is worth no more than $25.b**UPDATE** I've had this lamp for about 10 months now and I can no longer dim the light. When I try to dim the light, it emits a horrible ringing noise at a brain-piercing pitch. It's truly horrible. I'm looking for a replacement now so I can finally throw this thing in the garbage.

There just seems to be some defects in the ones I got. I theorize that it is just a simple defect in the engineering of the product. Hope all goes well with future products.I will update this to a 3/5 rating because of how great the customer service was. They definitely believe in their product and are confident that this was a rare issue.'*End of updates*'June 3, 2019'I contacted the seller. They are really nice and helpful. I advised them of the defects of my product. They indicated that they are willing to send a replacement. They requested me to upload a video of the defects to their upload site. I thought this was a great idea because it shows that they really care about their product, and want to actually know whats wrong with it. And it also shows that they are confident in their product due to the fact that they want to make sure people are not lying to them. I uploaded the video successfully and they agreed that it was defective. They then sent me a replacement model.'I received the replacement today and although it performed slightly better than the first one I got, it still had similar defects on the top panel. Lets face it, I didn\'t buy this product solely to be used as a lamp. The speaker and control feature of this product was something I really wanted to use. And for this price, it should work flawlessly! The new issues are as follows: When connecting to bluetooth and playing music, the - button does not go to the previous track as it is supposed to do. In the video I had sent them you can see me hold down the - button and even tap it multiple times, and all it does is reduce the volume. It does not go to the previous track. Further, in the video they can see see that the +\' button increases the volume when I tap it and when I hold it down. Sometimes, even when I simply tap the + button it goes to the next song instead of increasing the volume. And when I just want to go to the next song without increasing the volume by tapping the + button, the volume will increase while going to the next song. So imagine it was night time, and I was using the product before bed and listening to music. Say I wanted to go to the next song at a low volume/whatever it is at, if I hold down + the volume would drastically increase while going to the next song, deeming the product defective and not performing to its intended purpose. In the video they can also see me holding down the + to go to the next song but all it is doing is increasing the volume.'Seeing that they are confident in their product. I personally think the batch that is at the amazon warehouse is defective or treated poorly. Even though it is an expensive product, it is a cheap quality. So if in the warehouse they are being moved around without care, this could cause some damages like this. I will update accordingly if need be. But I am still firm on my stance of do not buy.'May 30, 2019'DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT FOR THIS PRICE - DEFECTIVE PRODUCT - RIP OFF'bThe lamp came in today but seems to not work. The volume panel is not working and the fader for the light is not seamless. Seems to be a slight delay/lag in tracking up and down the touch pad. For this price, I would not expect these defects. I can't even imagine what their margins are. I feel ripped off. They market this product as high end and premium quality, but it does not seem to be the case.I will change this review once an adequate solution is provided.

Each level offers a different type of light. Then these levels can be adjusted to plus or minus the intensity for more or less light for each setting.bThe lamp is made from black glossy plastic in a simple, sleek design. The LED bulb doesn't create heat which is a huge plus for me. The bulb isn't replaceable but from reading the answers section it's rated to last for almost 20 years. The unit comes with a 1 year warranty.I love the On/Off button which works with just the slightest touch of your finger - no struggling with toggles and when off there\'s a tiny red light to show where the button is. The light goes across horizontally and you can push the arm forward to have the light more across your work. The lamp bar can be lowered as well. The light doesn\'t shine in your eyes, the lap top screen or the tv. I run a fan in summer on my desk and the slim profile of the lamp doesn\'t block the flow at all. The base is about 6 1/2 square and has a low profile. The base isn\'t super heavy but is heavy enough to keep the lamp from moving and there\'s rubber on the base.'bThere's a USB port to charge the cell phone as well.

The base is solid and hefty, though some may consider it excessively large.'As far as the LEDs go, brightness is better than expected (and the figures touted by other reviews are accurate- output is around 500-550 lumens) and the ability to operate different modes is excellent- reading activates both the yellow and white LEDs, while study mode activates white LEDs only. This allows for a great level of flexibility and in my opinion can replace the role of SAD lights as the wavelength emitted is broadly in the same spectrum.'Another thing to note is that the on/off buttons remain illuminated once plugged in so there is a small passive draw on the outlet, and that the power adapter is rated for 110 to 240V, so if one were to relocate there would be no issues with compatibility.'bOverall, for $60 I'm very impressed. The brightness would be less than say, a florescent tube lamp of the same price, but the low power draw and heat of LEDs, the ability to charge one USB port (ipad mini compatible) and multiple light settings offset these negatives. I would wholeheartedly recommend this product if not for the fact that there is no diffuser and hence glare may be an issue. The oxyled smart may be the more prudent choice if that is your concern.

The problem is that it started to fail after a week or something, only the color mode was working and the white light stopped working. The external product quality is quite good, besides the power brick which does not inspire confidence. Because I didn't wanted to spend all the time that it requires to return a product I disassembled the lamp and found that the ribbon data/power cable that communicates a little motherboard with the led lighting was not correctly connected at one of the ends (the end that requiring a full disassemble :( ). Obviously, they didn't checked the quality of the assembly because it was pretty obvious, even a latch was broken.bIt's a shame, because the quality of the individual components looks and feels quite good (besides the power brick which seems cheap) but the assembly of my particular unit was awful.At the end of the day, it seems like a generic kind of cheap made in china lamp which was rebranded. So I guess you are better buying cheaper options.'Pros:'- Nice lightning'- Work as described (if your lamp is luckily well assembled)'- Good parts quality'Cons:'- Bad assembly quality'- Bad quality control'- Cheap power brick'- It cannot be turned on with a wall light switch' ","Reviewed in Canada on October 21, 2016",5,Alexis, 'Great Customer Support'

I don't use the RGB much so it's not the end of the world, and even when I use it it's basically noticeable if you're really paying attention and staring at the lamp.Another minor thing was that the white part has a seem running vertically?

B00APAQSP6," 'This is generally a well-designed product. But it misses in a few key areas:'1. The biggest issue--as with most LED lighting products--is the harsh quality of the light. The blue-white colour on the 2 reading modes will trouble anyone (like myself) with the slightest light sensitivity. The 3rd mode, relax, mostly solves the problem by shifting the light colour into the warm part of the colour spectrum. However, the brightness suffers as a result and there should be more light output to overcome this. This is the setting that most people will find comfortable, I believe, for all their tasks...and it is just not bright enough.'2. Kudos to the heavily-weighted base which makes the unit difficult to overturn. However, the rest of the lamp is all plastic--and very lightweight plastic at that. It does not inspire confidence in the longevity of the lamp, especially the potential for breakage if overturned or over-manipulated.

B00APAQSP6," 'bThis is, in my opinion and after testing many desk lights, one of the best I've used. To put it simply, the feature set, design considerations, good styling, and versatility make this lamp a worthwhile consideration if you are looking to buy a new desk lamp/bed light/general reading light.Feature set: With plenty of both blue- and incandescent-tinted LEDs, this is lamp is able to provide 4 lighting modes: sleep, relax, study, and read. In each mode, the intensity of the light can be adjusted in 5 steps, going from rather dusk-like dimness in the sleep mode to full-on bright reading intensity in study mode. Each mode uses a specific combination of the 2 types of LED lights and produces different temperatures that really do work for the suggested proposes: the study mode is great for students like me, as it keeps you up and awake almost like a strong cup of coffee!'Along with the lighting modes, there is a sleep timer for 60 mins that also works like a charm. The lighting selection pad is touch-sensitive, and I have never had issues with it. Not only is it super sensitive unlike those cheap touch pads on other electronics, the use of dim, red LED lights in the touch pad to illuminate the different modes and power buttons is nice. When the lamp is off, the power button is not only lit red to easily find in the darkness, it doesn\'t disturb you when the room is pitch-dark!'bDesign: What can I say? It's the nicest looking lamp I have seen! It's sleek, glossy, with a stable base. You can't accidentally knock over the lamp in normal use, and all the hinges seem strong and durable. The coolest thing about LEDs is that they produce a very nice, non-fatiguing light unlike other bulb-based designs, and so you will eventually come to appreciate the technology here.The lamp also swivels around its base 360 degrees, but the power cord (which is detachable) prevents it from swivelling all the way around (not that you expected it to, anyway).'Overall, this is a great product. As long as it holds up to daily use, which shouldn\'t cause too much strain, I can see this being my primary desk lamp for years to come. So long to those architect lamps that I held so dear to myself: these lamps are far superior in every way, providing the same lighting with the added benefits of design, styling, and thoughtful features.'

The touch sensitive buttons are really cool and the fact that the power button glows when its off makes it really easy to find in the dark, but its a little too easy to turn on. I regularly accidentally activate or deactivate the light with my knuckle when i put my phone down on its base, brushing up against the button.'I also wish that the light could be turned on by selecting one of the different setting options. Sometimes I want to turn the light on with a dimmer setting at night or turn it on with a brighter setting during the evening and afternoon. Having to turn the lamp on first to change the setting it a bit tedious and can get annoying if you had it set really high or low previously and have to adjust it immediately after turning it on.

B00APAQSP6," 'I was a fan of the Anker Lumos A2 that I decided to try the TaoTronics Elune. Other reviews have covered lighting temperatures and I agree that both the lamps are fantastic and versatile. I have used this one in particular for building hobby kits. This review will not compare the Anker and the TaoTronics, but I will note that there are some similarities (the overall design and functionality) and also notable differences (the TT has a shorter lamp head so it folds down completely and the power cord jack is on the back.)'bThe main issue I have with this lamp is the build quality. As another reviewer has stated, it feels cheap. Tapping on the plastic and feeling the overall weight, it did not feel sturdy enough and I'm a bit concerned with the stiffness in the joints. Having the arm up and the head 90 degrees from it (like in the product image), I banged on the table a bit and the head began to dip a little.The base of the lamp is nice and heavy, however the one I received does not sit level with the desk. Pressing down on the corners of the base, the lamp wobbles as if there is a small space between the corners and the desk.'bOverall still a very nice lamp. The look and the size is very nice for any desk. It's just too bad the price doesn't really justify the overall quality of the lamp.

One less power converter using current when off.'-*NEW* The charging USB port has high power, it manages to feed enough power to my Nexus 5X for the fast charge mode.

Great feature.'Cons: (no deal breakers but still...)'-Although rotation and angles are well documented, i was disappointed that I did not notice it was not as flexible as my other, older, desk lamps.'-When off, the power button has a pretty bright red LED behind it. That is a nuisance if the lamp is in your bedroom. I covered it with electrical tape and the controls still work but that might not be cool for everyone.'-The rotating connection between the weight plate and the vertical arm is a bit wobbly, nothing major, but a bit annoying when you move the lamp.'b-The plastic looks awesome but doesn't feel sturdy.

Very colourful and professionally crafted.'(+) Inside the box, there was nice styrofoam padding to keep the LED lamp in mint condition.'(+) Main package contents include the LED Lamp, Power Adapter, Social Media Card, and a very informative User Manual'(+) A microfibre cleaning cloth was also included.'What Needs Improvement:'(-) N/A - Great overall job with the packaging.' DESIGN 'What is Good:'(+) Elegant Design.'(+) Brushed aluminum coating'(+) Sturdy Circular Shaped Base bottom.'(+) Touch-Sensitive dimmer slider to control brightness (11 levels of brightness)'(+) A temperature button to control the warmth / colour modes (5 options)'(+) The neck of the lamp can swivel to turn a 90 degree range of motion.'(+) The headlamp can bend 135 degrees vertically and also turn 90 degrees left or right.'(+) Includes a USB-input port that allows you to charge USB capable devices.'What Needs Improvement:'(-) It would be better if there was a great range of motion all around. It would be great if there was a 360 degree range of motion for each of the areas as opposed to the 90 degree and 135 degree limitations.' FUNCTIONALITY 'What is Good:'(+) There is a noticeable difference in the nits produced at each of the 11 levels of brightness. The lowest setting is great when you need just a touch of illumination; and the highest setting is excellent when you really need to brighten up the space.'(+) The 5-colour temperature settings are also noticeable different from one another and their brightness can also be controlled by the touch-sensitive dimmer!'(+) The LED lamp is easy to turn on (simply tap on the POWER symbol on the touch-sensitive dimmer).'(+) To power it off, hold down on the POWER symbol for about 2 seconds and it will shut off.'What Needs Improvement:'(-) Would be great if they include some MIXED temperature settings that blend together two or more different colour temperatures.' EASE OF USE 'What is Good:'(+) Very easy to use. Excellent inclusion of the touch-sensitive dimmer.'What Needs Improvement:'(-) N/A - works very smoothly as advertised. The touch-sensitive dimmer makes it a breeze to operate.' FINAL THOUGHTS 'This is a very well built and sturdy LED lamp. The circular base provides a solid foundation and keeps the lamp upright at all times. TaoTronics has certainly put a lot of effort into quality assurance to make sure that the weight is properly distributed so that the lamp remains balanced at all times. There have been instances where I ve tested other LED lamps to find that they topple over because they are not weighted properly, so kudos to TaoTronics for getting this done right.'The illumination produced by this lamp and the variety of temperature options on this lamp are both solid winners. The radiances and illumination will not disappoint you. It offers everything that most people would hope for out of an LED desk lamp. The only thing I wish to be added is a bit more variety in the temperature settings; including some mixed modes that can blend two or more different hues of light together. Aside from that, this is an excellent LED desk lamp for your home or office space and I highly recommend it at a price of $50 or less.'*Note: Product was received at a fully or partially discounted rate in exchange for a fair and honest review.'**Feel free to contact me if you have any specific questions about this review or questions regarding the product.'

It's also quite bright at its highest settings (although, the differences between individual brightness settings on the slider bar aren't always enough to seem significant).Yet, contrary to the description, this lamp does NOT have 5 colour settings. It only has 2: a warm yellow light, and a cool bluish light. It DOES have 6 different brightness levels for each colour, though. So, you get a total of 12 possibilities, plus the nightlight.'The 6 buttons on the base are for: 1) On/Off, 2) Warm Light (has 6 brightness settings), 3) Cool Light (has 6 brightness settings), 4) to program a default favourite light setting (easily done), 5) to set a 60-minute off timer, & 6) Night Light (1 brightness only).

Nice even very bright light for reading and fine craft work etc. Also the ability to adjust colour temperature from bright white to soft amber is really useful. The variable intensity adjustment could be finer as, in my view, there are not enough steps between full bright and low. The low could be less bright. The range of the arm adjustments is adequate except there could be an up and down hinge where the light unit attaches to the top arm. The base is nice and heavy and will not tilt if the light is extended forwards.'bThe only disappointment is that it is a little stiff to adjust and one needs to hold the base when adjusting, especially to swivel. I expected it to adjust easily with a finger touch without having to hold the base with my other hand, and yet stay in position, like the anglepoise lamps from the 70's, but it is not so. The styling is good for an office but may not suite every situation in a home.The finish is satisfactory and the whole lamp is aluminium with an acrylic cover on the base, much better than the many cheaper plastic ones, it has a solid feel to it. The touch controls work but sometimes require an additional tap. The night light is very useful. It looses the memory/favourite setting when the power goes off. The USB charging port is excellent and charges quickly.Whilst not cheap at the price, for what it is, it is good value. Many reviews give the impression that this is an incredibly wonderful thing. Perhaps because of that I expected more.' ","Reviewed in Canada on August 18, 2017",3,Charlie," 'Better than the competition, nice even light, very bright if needed.' "

There are three color modes and a couple options for each, ranging from very warm and orange to a very sharp cold blue. There are lots of settings in between so you should be able to find one that you really like. The touch buttons work well, although some icons are arbitrary and meaningless and they're not in the correct order. It's imperfect but totally acceptable. If I was going to be really critical, it would be nice to have a diffuse cover on the night light part, as the light it produces isn't as soft as I would like, and I don't really understand the point of it but it's fine and works nicely. I would love it if there was an option to adjust the brightness of the touch buttons.

B00APAQSP6," 'bI purchased this lamp to use at school and it's been doing exactly what I need and more. Starting with the looks, it has a piano black finish that looks really sleek. However, it is prone to fingerprints. A microfiber cloth is included so you can keep it nice and shiny. The base is really solid and sturdy so you do not need to worry about the lamp toppling over. The lamp can swivel around so you can adjust it to any situation. My only gripe with the design is that I wish that the swivel was not as loose as it is. It would be nice to have some slight resistance when turning it.There are 4 different light levels on this lamp with individual brightness settings for each. They are as follows: Reading, Study, Relax and Sleep. The reading and study modes send out a very white light while the relax and sleeping modes send out a more yellow-ish light so it is easier on your eyes. I found these customization options to be very convenient. This lamp also comes with a 60 minute timer, which I found to be useful because I often fall asleep with the light on. Even after I left the lamp on for a considerable amount of time, the LEDs were only warm at most.'bThere is a 1A USB port on the right side of the lamp for charging your phone. While it is useful for charging older phones, a 2A USB port would be more appropriate with today's phones. This is something I'd like to see if there was ever a second revision produced.Overall, this is a really useful lamp and is a good buy because it is always on sale.

The company, TaoTronics, admitted it was probably defective in a public comment, then changed their tune and said the crackling and flickering are normal when using the USB port after I emailed them about the problem. The crackling sound was definitely a sign of faulty, defective electronics which could pose a fire hazard. I do not recommend these lamps at all if they are still making and selling them.'UPDATED. It\'s a very nice lamp, but has one big flaw: when an iPhone is connected to the built-in USB port, the light flickers and it makes a very soft crackling sound that makes it seem like there\'s an electrical problem with the lamp. The seller claims this is normal, which I found odd. I would not leave the house with something plugged in and charging on this lamp in case there is an electrical problem.'There are 5 different color settings for the light, from bright white to a soft golden light. It has 12 different levels of brightness which is nice. Design is clean and sleek with a handy USB port built into the base for charging a cellphone. Two negatives: the cord is a bit short, so unless the outlet is nearby you\'ll probably need an extension cord. The light swivels in different places, which offers lots of ways to position the lamp. But where the lamp arm part meets the elbow gets a lot of stress when bending it, especially if you move the lamp part it by the tip (which is how it appears to be designed to work). Because of the swivel connection there, I\'m worried it\'ll snap off one of these days when bending it to a different position.'

It also has different brightness settings which make it easy to control the intensity of the light. The overall design of the lamp make it very ideal to brightening up the room in terms of design. It has a very nice silver finish with a great base. It may not be the most ideal lamp for dark color rooms as it may clash with the color of the room. The setting were very easy to use and learn for basic beginners; however, there is a manual if you wish to know more about the settings and what they are used for. The metal of the stand makes the product very sturdy and very hard to break. It can definitely handle the weight of the lamp no problem.

This is the best lamp I've ever tried-truly I have eye problems and this lamp doesn't not give me any headaches either using it to read with or just watching tv. This lamp would also be great to use, which I have-with just about any kind of crafts. If you do a lot of reading it is super, you can adjust the lighting and the color to the type of paper that's used in either books or newspaper, for a non glare this is the best. The only thing I would change if I had the chance would be, to be able to turn the head of the lamp at a 360 degree angle so the light could shine on the ceiling and give off more of the light to a bigger area. But for a desk lamp this is an amazingly bright. I like the style sleek and doesn't take up a lot of room. I also like the bonus-usb plug- to be able to charge my phone at the base of this unit, this really comes in handy. It comes neatly folded in a box-would make an excellent gift.

If they change it back to white, this is a nice little lamp; otherwise I would buy one of the cheaper versions without the base light since it's unpleasant and hard on the eyes as it is - no reason to spend extra for that feature anymore.

(I have to touch the base whenever adjusting the long neck, dusting the glossy base or moving the unit itself on my desk)3) While the seven brightness settings is handy, the seven separate areas to touch are crammed together and difficult to hit individually, especially if you have bigger hands like I do. Perhaps more expensive to manufacture, but a scroll dimmer (like on an Ipad screen) would be far superior.'b4) Personally, not big on the glossy base.

B00APAQSP6," 'bI spent a lot of time looking for the perfect desk lamp. I always find myself spending a lot of time at my desk when the sun goes down. With my desk in the corner of my room, little to no light is directed in that area. Having this lamp is perfect because it's tall enough (17 inch) to illuminate my whole desk and small enough to take up as little room as possible. The light settings are perfect for every situation. The gooseneck is as flexible and struby as it needs to be. My only gripe about the product is the base. The touch sensitive buttons work 95% of the time but it isn't comfortable to slide your finger accross the button pad. Overall, I'm happy with my purchase and the price of the product while there can be some inmprovements made.

I tend to use it on the highest setting. And it works AMAZING.bThis seller also deserves 5 stars. I placed an order on Friday. 24 hours later, on a SATURDAY, I had my order.

No loud clicks when you turn it on or off; no fumbling for a switch if you need to get up in the night. Simply tap the slider area and the lamp comes on. Depending on what level of light you desire, the slider (which is not a physical slider but simply a smooth line on the base that senses where your fingertip is) can adjust the light to seven different levels. You can take it from a bright level intensity for study or reading, through to a relaxing ambient light.'bThis is a terrific product for the money, easy on the eyes (in more ways than one), and highly energy efficient.

B00APAQSP6," 'The goal of any desk lamp is to help you to become as productive as possible. However, looking for the perfect desk lamp is not an easy task. Many are designed purely with aesthetics in mind but lack soul and originality. But what if you could combine both into one package?'First Impressions: I found the modern and sleek design of the LED lamp to fit in most contemporary desk setups. The stand out feature of course is the large LED array that sits attached nimbly to the adjustable neck coated in a rubber skin. The construction of the lamp and base of the unit is made with a relatively cheap plastic that does not seem too durable. Unit feels well balanced within the standard range of movement but will become unstable in unfamiliar positions. Included is a standard AC power adapter that plugs into the rear of the unit.'Function: The unit has 6 settings to choose from: On, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, Full. In theory, using a lamp is pretty simple because it s either on or off. However, this design is a little peculiar in the usability and will require some training to get used to the functions. First, powering on the unit is a simple tap and the unit will fire up to the default 3 setting. If you tap the power button again, it will take you back to the 1 setting. By either gliding your finger across or simply tapping each setting along the way, the unit will adjust its brightness accordingly. The confusing part is when you try to turn off the unit because instinctively, I would press a button for an action to take place. But, tapping the power button will take to level 1 instead of the default 3. I know, I know it s confusing but the only way to turn off the device is to hold down the power button for 2 seconds and the unit will turn off.'On the brighter side, (no pun intended), the LED lamp arrays produce a vibrant and clear light source that does not strain the eye. It is rather brilliant so be careful when looking directly at it. The length of the power cord was a little too short in my opinion which limited my placement options, but I did find the adjustable neck to be useful in shooting the light toward the ceiling and creating an ambient light source that fills the room. As an LED it consumes 75% less power than traditional incandescent lights, it can save on your electricity too.'Conclusion: Alright, so is the LED lamp worth your hard earned money? For sure! Despite its quirky user interface and decent build quality, the product does deliver the performance, function and energy savings that you would expect at this price point. With some improvements, this product would receive a perfect score.' ","Reviewed in Canada on July 9, 2015",4,Fred L, 'LED bliss at the glide of a button!'

It is a good light for your bedroom or use as a reading lamp (ipad, kindle, etc) as it will not disturb anyone. It has several setting for light intensity and is quite good; even in a darkened room. It is small (and light), adjustable and does not take up space nor does it generate tons of heat or glare. It would be good for home, office, cottage or trailer. The adapter is not USB charger but a pin plug. Well recommended if you wear glasses (reading or otherwise).'An idea to add to this product would be a USB charge port so you could also charge your device while using it. Maybe for next revision. The pricing may be a tad too high (Canadian) without the addition of a USB port in order to bring it in line with other similar day vision LED lights on the market.'The description here is slightly incorrect as it does not seem to contain a cleaning cloth - the manual lists the box contents and it was nowhere to be found BUT no matter use the same cloth that you clean your screen with (a soft cloth - no liquid) and be sure to unplug before cleaning.'Great light ... love the slide intensity .. could probably play with that function all day.

B00APAQSP6," ' This is the future of desk lamps. Traditional desk lamps, which utilize lightbulbs that have to be replaced once in a while, are a thing of the past.'Physically, the TaoTronics LED Desk Lamp comes with a quite compact footprint. It is smaller than the usual lightbulb-desk lamp. The panel that contains the LEDs is quite small, and the base is small as well - I had expected the lamp to be much larger. The desk lamp features shiny black plastic construction all around - because of this, although the lamp has solid build construction, the base, which has touch controls for power and brightness control, can draw fingerprints really easily. Personally, I would have appreciated if TaoTronics used matte finish plastic all around. The only part that is not shiny black plastic is the gooseneck, which is made of soft-touch plastic. Speaking of which, the gooseneck works EXTREMELY well, and is very flexible. The gooseneck will bend to the most extreme angles, allowing you to shine the lamp at almost anything from its fixed position.'However, do not underestimate this lamp. Functionally, the array of LEDs that are in this thing can get REALLY dim, and they can also get REALLY bright. The brightness range on this desk lamp is phenomenal in my opinion. The different settings of brightness on this lamp can suit the darkest environments to the least dark environments. On top of that, the LEDs come with the eye-protection feature, which will prevent your eyesight from being worsened by the light from this lamp.'bOverall, the TaoTronics Desk Lamp is an amazing product, and it would be a perfect product if it weren't for the slightly annoying shiny black plastic construction.

Whether you are a business man working through the night, a student studying all night, or just a person looking for a lamp beside their bed, this a a great lamp to consider.'Unlike conventional lamps which you could find mostly anywhere which takes light bulbs, you do not need to go through the annoying process of changing light bulbs. Also, you can forget about the hot light bulbs that may pose threat to you at any given time. Thanks to the LEDs, this lamp does not get hot, it gets a little warm, but very slightly, only until the point you can touch the lamp. Also, since these are LEDs, you do not need to change the bulbs as I mentioned.'The design of this lamp is really outstanding. In my opinion, judging from the pictures, I was kind of skeptical of what the product was going to feel like. I anticipated a cheap plasticy product, considering the price. However, what I got was surprising. Although it was constructed out of plastic, it feels very nice, premium, and durable. I also appreciated little touches such as the rubber sleeve for the gooseneck part, the opaque cover for the light which lets you look directly at the light. Also, I absolutely dig the touch controls. The controls on this thing is really futuristic, all touch controls, very convenient and easy to use. The brightness can be adjusted through a easy sliding motion, and there are enough brightness levels to suit your different needs.'Overall, this is an amazing lamp for the price you are paying for. The product is surprisingly very nicely made, and it will fit any bedroom with no problem what so ever, and it will just give that modern touch to where ever you put this lamp.

It came in a very neat, compact package, with a handle.'bThe problem I have with the energy saving light bulbs is that the colour is too cold and they are really hard on the eyes. That's why I have been putting off changing my light bulbs to LED. This lamp, thankfully, is one of the better ones. You can slide your finger on the bar at the base of the lamp to select one of the 7 settings. The maximum is really bright. I find the lower settings are better, and you should try not to look directly at the light.My only complaint is that the flexible gooseneck is too short. I tried to put this on the bedside table for reading, as a test, but no matter how I try to adjust it without pointing the light at myself, my head ends up above the light. The lack of height of the lamp also makes it difficult to use a higher intensity setting and point it at the ceiling to get a reflected ambient light.'bAs with all LED lights, you don't have to worry about its longevity.

I've gone through the entire line of desk lamps of nearly every description. I can honestly say that this lamp exceeds my expectations.First of all, the lamp arrived neatly and securely packaged. With that alone you are given the sense that this is a quality piece of equipment. I have not been disappointed.'The lamp is fully adjustable to a multitude of heights up to about 13-14 inches (34-35 cm give or take). Way too high for my liking but even at that height the light on your desk is plenty bright to eliminate eye strain in dark or dimly lit offices. The head of the lamp is fairly thin and hides the bulbs entirely. The lamp has a solid base as well. It is not easily tipped. Another very nice touch is that the lamp never shines in your eyes. There is no upward glare from the light at all so my eyes feel rested even after a longer session doing my desk work.'One of the top features for me is the seven levels of light brightness. Yes that is right seven levels!!! There is one for everyone\'s viewing preference. No buttons to push ... merely slide your finger across the setting ... and voila ... the light fades or brightens to that level. Hold the off spot for a couple of seconds and the light shuts off. I was experimenting with this function before I even had a chance to read the manual which accompanies the lamp. Exactly how a product should be in my opinion.'I would recommend this lamp to anyone who is looking for a quality desk lamp.

You could use this as a night stand light if you wanted and so positioned, or even to backlight behind your TV.The other big USP is the custom lights. You can have a warm reading light or a keep me awake style natural blue light. Select as you will, choose what\'s best for your eyes and for the task at hand. As I was thinking about this I\'m actually inclined to recommend this for model builders and precise painters etc, as you can achieve a lighting position and brightness designed for precision work.'bThe base is also the right weight to keep this in place on your desk, so a slight tap won't send it topping over.Pros:'* Custom light'* Custom positioning'* Well built for the task'* Sturdy build and the right weight'Cons:'* None'I was given a sample in exchange for an honest opinion' ","Reviewed in Canada on July 26, 2015",5,Henry Armitage, 'Choose your own lighting scenarios.'

It has a non-ghosting and non-flickering bulb, an intuitive touch siding controller, and a reflective, unidirectional, and vision-friendly LED lighting head. With each purchase, you get a full one-year worry free manufacturer s warranty. This unit provides 7 watts of pleasant light output that is easy on your eyes. The controls for the lamp are very nice. The far left of the strip is the on and off and the rest of the bar controls brightness. You can tap the bar at the level you want, or gently slide your finger up and down the bar to control the level. There are seven distinct brightness levels but the smoothness of the control makes it feel like a continuous gradation. The best thing about it is that when the lamp is turned off and back on, your brightness level isn t reset. The neck responds well and can be easily adjusted to direct the light in almost any position you desire and feels velvety to the touch. I am not sure what the neck is manufactured out of but it seems to be quite solid and elegant at the same time. We mostly use this lamp on our desk in our computer loft at home however my wife occasionally borrows it for the night stand in our bedroom so she can read a book on low setting which provides her plenty of light for reading yet low enough to allow me to fall asleep without bothersome bright light from an incandescent table light.

Right now I have a sock covering the whole thing, but it's annoying.No easy way to turn off the light from the lowest brightness setting.

A metal base that is touch sensitive and high quality hard plastic for the upper shell. Easily bright enough for a bedside lamp or to add ambience to a room. The entire metal base is one button, you can touch anywhere to change brightness or modes.'bThe colour changing mode requires a long press and then slowly cycles through the colours. It'd be very nice to add to a room but not as the sole light source. You can give it another touch when on the colour cycle to choose which colour you'd like it to stay on putting you in control. The only downside to this is that it does cycle pretty slowly, so if you miss the exact shade you're looking for you'll be waiting another 30 seconds or so for it to come around again.bOverall this would be great as a gift for a dorm, a teenager's room, or even as a desk lamp.

B00APAQSP6," 'High quality LED lamp with a sleek modern design and a lot of light modes with many colours available.'bThis Aukey Lamp has a really outstanding quality. It looks fairly simple, yet aesthetically modern design which pleases the eye. It is not too big in size, and would easily fit onto a night stand. Its really great to use at a bedside with its dimmable light and touch controls. The lamp doesn't take up much space, with the design opting for a taller build rather than a large lamp. The materials feel very high quality and while the lamp is still very fragile, it has a pretty durable construction.bThe lamp is very efficient, powered by a small DC cable with a small output. The inner LED has a very long life span and consumes a very small amount of power to work. There are multiple light modes available, from very bright to really low and in between. But the lamp's functionality moves beyond that point - with the touch button at the Aukey logo point, which I admit is a bit of a pain to use and switch in between modes. In the different light mode, the lamp works in switching between 5-6 colours, although there is no obvious way to dim the lamp in such mode of different colours. The lamp looks really nice when set to colours such as blue, yellow, or green. The glow is pretty nice and colours look really authentic.bWhile it was a bit annoying to attempt switching modes in this lamp, its even more annoying trying to modify the individual colour of the lamp - its supposed to feature 256 different colours for a great deal of customization for one's liking. But in fact, the touch-like interface is very clunky to use and you end up reverting back to the standard light modes more frequently than getting the desired results. This is really a single issue I have been able to find with this lamp, but nonetheless its quite annoying. The touch-like interface could have been modified, or better yet, this lamp really would benefit from an app connection. That way, the lamp colours can be easily controlled and it would be smooth to navigate colour options. This is something to consider for product improvement, as phone app controls can really benefit the product. The colours are really nice looking and when you do get to customize it to your liking, the lamp is exceptional.This Aukey LED lamp is a high quality product with a lot of different colours. Aside from the horrible light control, the lamp allows for a great deal of colours. This is a perfect addition to any night stand and the lamp looks really great, with taking up very little space also. Great quality product, would recommend.'

B00APAQSP6," 'I own a lot of essential oil diffusers and humidifiers simply because I enjoy the warm ambiance of their colorful LED lighting, and I was intrigued to check out this LED bedside lamp, because it appeared to include many of the features I enjoy on my lights, only without the water reservoir of diffusers. I was incredibly impressed with the lamp I received.'bThis LED bedside lamp is a great medium-sized tabletop lamp which includes an adapter and a set of instructions. The instructions are simple and straightforward and the lamp doesn't require any assembly. It is 9 inches tall in size and weighs around 1.5 pounds. It has a color temperature of between 2900-3100K, so it gives off warm white light (not daylight spectrum), as well as a plethora of different colors of light. The LEDs are said to last around 35,000 hours and the lamp's exterior is mad from an attractive combination of ABS plastic and aluminum alloy.This light has no buttons, but rather it is turned on off and switched into different modes simply by touching the aluminum portion of the lamp. When powered on, the notification LED is blue, and then you can touch the lamp to turn it on. Initially, it will be on the dimmest of three brightness settings for the warm white lamp. If you press it a second time, the lamp will become brighter, and if you press it once more, it will become brighter yet. Pressing it once more will turn off the lamp.'If instead you press the lamp and hold your finger there for three seconds, the lamp will swap to a color changing mode that cycles between a beautiful array of bright colors. If you want to stop and hold on a particular color, you simply need to press the lamp once more and it will stop on the color of your choice. It will continue cycling if you press it again. This allows you to select, say, a pink or a light green, or any other color you so desire. I actually really appreciated this setting, because it allowed me to more closely match the LED lighting of this diffuser to some LED strip accent lighting I have nearby. I also want to point out that this LED lamp is significantly brighter than any of my essential oil diffuser lamps, which was a pleasant surprise!'bAnother pleasant surprise was that this lamp doesn't have any noises when you press it. There are no short beeping noises acknowledging when you press it, which I much prefer to my essential oil diffuser lamps. I currently use mine at work and really love it!This LED lamp quite easy to operate and functions completely as advertised. It works well, and is very bright, with an abundance of lighting options. Just keep in mind that you cannot control the brightness of it when it is in its color mode. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who is interested in a tabletop bedside LED lamp.'

B00APAQSP6," 'bThis is a really useful lamp. I have been particularly enjoying it over the holidays. It lets you change the colour and also the brightness. I really like having it set to red in the evening, it gives off a nice festive glow. To use the lamp, you simply touch the metallic base, and then touch it again until you reach the brightness you want. Then, long press the base and it will cycle through the colours. Tap it one time once it finds the colour you would like to use. The build quality on the lamp is great. It feels solid and heavy, and the finishes are really nice and of high quality. The base is metal and the top portion is plastic. With the LED bulb in this lamp it will probably last forever. My favourite feature is the colour selection. It really helps create a nice ambiance in the room you are using it in. The lamp doesn't give off a ton of light but it's more than enough for a small to medium sized room. Overall recommended!

B00APAQSP6," 'bI got this lamp on sale for about 50% off and am quite pleased with it. I wouldn't pay full price for this item, but for about $20 it is definitely a great purchase! For those of you wondering how this lamp works, basically it has two modes - one mode is white, and the other mode is coloured. When in the white mode, you can cycle between 3 different brightness settings which is really useful. When in the coloured mode, the lamp will cycle through a range of colour (it has a fade transition between each colour which is really nice) and you can pause it to make it stay on a certain colour. I'm giving this product 4 stars instead of 5 for two reasons: 1) it would be really cool if the coloured mode also had 3 brightness levels, but it does not, and 2) there's no way to skip or speed up the transition speed when in coloured mode, so if you want to pause it on a specific colour, you have to wait for it to change to that colour which can take about 30-60 seconds depending on what colour you want (it always seems to transition in the same order, so if the colour you want is towards the end of the rotation, you would have to wait for it each time). Neither of these issues are problematic, they were just things that I noticed that I felt could have been included or improved. But aside from that, I'm really happy with this lamp and will definitely keep my eyes out for it going on sale again, I would love to get another one (or maybe more) for my house!

The white light is brighter than expected, it's a warmer white and it is very easy on the eyes when using it late at night. I have to agree with other statements regarding the colour shifting issue. It isn't as smooth as I'd like it to be but I don't leave it in colour shifting mode usually. One issue I had with the lamp was the surprisingly bright blue LED indicator remained on even when the lamp was off. Being my bedside lamp, this blue light was affecting my sleep at night. I lived with it for a few months but it got to the point where I really didn't see the point in having a light indicate the device is off so I just removed the LED. The device works perfectly without it and now I don't have any more light in my room when I'm sleeping. ","Reviewed in Canada on October 25, 2017",5,Amazon Customer," 'Excellent bedside lamp, aside from the blue LED indicator' "
B00APAQSP6, 'I like this lamp. I wish I bought another one. Mine does not have the blue light that another reviewer spoke of. It is a dim orange and not noticeable in a dark room. The coloured lights are cool but I will likely not use them. It is bright enough on the highest setting to read but not glaringly so. I took off one star for the price. I bought this on Prime Day and so the price wasn t too bad. I think it s pricey when not on sale.

B00APAQSP6," 'The Aukey LED atmosphere lamp is a very cool, stylish, and fun light. Operation is simple - by touching the silver strip that wraps around the base you can turn it on, switch colours/modes, and turn it off. There are three different brightness settings and many different colours to lock the light to. The auto cycle feature is fun for a party or with friends over.'Lamp set up is very easy. Just plug it in and start using it.'bThis lamp is about 21 cm tall and 10 cm in diameter. Since it's LED, it doesn't get hot at all like incandescent lamps do. The energy-efficient LED lights inside are designed to last 35,000 hours - plenty of time before burning out. Should be noted that this lamp is not designed to have LED lights replaced, so the lamp is all-enclosed single unit.::::: Pros :::::'- Dimming settings'- Many different colour settings'- Party mode cycles through 200+ different colour shades'- Easy touch panel control'- Affordable'- Stylish'- Rated for 35,000 hours'::::: Cons :::::'- Touch control does take getting used to'- No way to replace LED lights'::::: Verdict :::::'Overall, this lamp is a fun product and has function in addition to the mood lighting capabilities.

No issues getting this into a position where it's lighting up what I want.- all the different color temperature settings!'- the different brightness settings!'- the looks! I think it looks great!'- the usb charging port!'b- the weight ... it's quite light, but still just heavy enough.- the swivel base. I don\'t think they advertise it, but whole light arm can swivel a little bit right at the base. Nice touch!'- the touch controls!'bHere's what could be better:- the power button should be one end of the touch panel, and it should have a little tactical bump or something on it so that you can feel it\'s the power button. As it\'s positioned right now, the power button is the 2nd button in from the left. As it\'s the button you\'re going to use the most, it should be on one end or the other making it easier to find and not accidentally hit another button.'b- when you turn on the lamp, it always goes back to max brightness. That can be really hard on the eyes if you're in a dark room. Be nice if it came back on at the brightness you last left it at.b- the usb charger needs more power. Yup, it's a 1 Amp. Yup, it'll charge a tablet (I have an iPad mini and it'll charge it). But at 1 Amp, that charging could take a long time (it won't charge nearly as fast as the stock 1 Amp charger you get with an iPad mini). I higher powered usb charger would be the icing on the cake.bOverall, I'm very happy with this lamp. The light you get from it is bright, even, and flicker-free. The ability to change the color temperature is awesome. The touch controls are very cool! And it just looks plain old awesome. I'm happy enough that I've bought 2 ... one for me and one for my wife.

This is my first taste of the future, and I guess the future is now!'The touch interface is great to use. I guess no mechanical buttons to wear out on me. But do touch interfaces wear out too? Someone more experienced than me at this will need to answer.'Has a timer that\'s auto set to 1 hour, and you can\'t change it. Has 5 different colour temperature settings that range from a warm 3000k to a cool 5500k. Has a night light mode that turns on just the tip of the lamp. The slide brightness control isn\'t continuous. You basically go through 7 brightness settings. The slider is 7 touch buttons place side by side. So in reality, you don\'t really need to do a sliding motion. You just need to press the corresponding line segment on the slider, and it will jump to that brightness.'bThe lamp is also very flexible and you can adjust the 3 swivel points to suit your needs. I wouldn't adjust them too much, as it can get loose later on, though I think it can be adjusted, if you remove the screws which are covered by rubber nubs, and do a little maintenance yourself.

B00APAQSP6," 'SUMMARY'Great lamp with all the features that you could possibly want. Does get a bit hot after a while and needs a higher current USB outlet. Recommended'PACKAGING'The box is pretty plain without much wow factor, but it is clean and has the right amount of text. Packaging was a little banged up due to shipping, but the insulation was good enough to weather the shipping without damaging the lamp. Inside, you\'ll find the lamp (already connected to the base), a power plug, manual and warranty card (2 years). The lamp is protected by a bag and sticky film on all glossy surfaces.'LAMP CONSTRUCTION'The lamp is well thought out. The base is heavy enough to stay stable with any position of the lamp. The lamp head is collapsable for a nice stowaway position when not in use. The lamp head can swing out to what looks like 120 degrees and tilt its lights 90 degrees from its pointing down axis. The arm can swing from flat to 90 degrees upright, and about 40 degree pivot from the base. The power cord looks to be around 6 feet, allowing for easy hookup to a wall socket or power bar.'LAMP FEATURES'The lamp has a multitude of features:'- Timer: 60 minute shut off feature (not tested)'- Color temp cycle: 5 color modes (yellow to blue) See pics for color samples'- Night light: it is a low powered yellow light to show you where the lamp is in the dark. Note that the lamp does not detect light intensity and turn on the night light, you have to turn it on and off yourself.'- Light intensity setting: 7 different intensities. See pics for intensity levels'bAll work well. The color temps actually make a difference and you could change based on the ambient lighting. The intensities are dim and bright enough to get you what you want. With the lamp light being so long, the Aukey casts light over a large area. One note is that the lamp head gets noticeably hot after a while of operation at the highest intensity. I don't know if this will affect lifetime of the lamp.USB CHARGER'The usb port is supposed to output 1A. Hooked up to a Nexus 6P, it was outputing 661mA. Good enough to charge, but I would like a larger output (2A or so). See pic.'CONCLUSION'bBest LED lamp I've bought. Aukey has done it again with a great design and abundant features. I've recommended this lamp to others and they are equally as impresed as I am by the looks and performance. Just get a higher output on the USB port and I don't know how else you could improve on this.

It charges my iPhone at a snail pace.'- Power supply is not UL listed'bOverall, I'd recommend this lamp to anyone looking for a good looking budget-conscious lamp with lots of adjustability and different temperature lighting.EDIT: Aukey reached out to me regarding some of my concerns and sent me a new unit which has remedied my biggest concerns.

Soon I got a good deal and ordered immediately.'Everything is as good as mentioned in other reviews: lots of adjustments, good light output, different color temperature, timer, stable stand, good appearance, etc.'I also agree that it would make this light perfect if the USB port can output 2A instead of 1A. I use it to charge cell phone only. So 1A is fine for me.'As a habit, I measure everything measurable when I get a new product. Well, the max power this lamp consumes is 11 Watts. So the output is a bit below 11 Watts. Still, very bright. Actually the highest brightness setting is too bright for continuous reading or working. Both I and my child prefer level 5 for working and reading. Level 7 is good for delicate work, such as examining circuit board, for not more than a few minutes.'bIf you have a 10-11V battery pack, you can use this lamp as an emergency light during a power outage. 1AH from your battery pack will keep this lamp at brightness 7 for almost an hour. Isn't it handy? Of course, you need a cord that can connect your battery pack to this lamp.Added on 30th Jan 2017'bI bought one more for my kid's desk 2 weeks ago. The second one is just as good as the first one. To be picky, I measured and compared the power consumption of both...almost the same. Brightness and color temperature? I don't have a lux meter, but visually, I cannot find a difference between the two units. So I can say the quality control of this lamp is also good.

B00APAQSP6," 'I previously bought a bunch of lamps (some of them being good brands) and spent a lot of money, but none were as good as i expected them to be. This one here is truly satisfying ! Its lightweight (2.8 pounds/1.27kg) yet it feels like very good quality material. It has 7 levels of brightness for every situation you need, plus a very soft light to use before sleeping or even while doing so. It also has 5 types of lights going from bright white to yellow, adjustable on a touch panel. This lamp provides an auto-off timer that automatically turns the light off after an hour. The base is very rigid so no need to worry about the lamp falling or accidentally moving. The lamp has different adjustments, so it can be placed almost everywhere without worrying about the light not reaching specific places. Its eco-friendly and uses 75% less energy with an estimated 50000 hours lifespan (so its also pocket-friendly !). It also has a usb slot for charging your phone (or other devices) which is very practical.

B00APAQSP6," 'This desk lamp has several different features that I enjoyed - a couple minor things but no biggie, this has now become the lamp at my bedside!'bI love being able to control the warmth and brightness of the light. I'm able to put it on low in the evenings, or higher in the mornings if need be. It's also able to be very bright white or warmer similar to an incandescent bulb. There is also a nightlight function that only illuminates the tip of the lamp giving off very little light as not to disturb others around you.bThe build is a fairly sturdy plastic, although it is prone to fingerprints and dust. It's lightweight and easy to move positions or take to another desk if need be in a pinch. All buttons along the base of the lamp are touch sensitive. I would have liked there to be some ridges or bumps for the power button, making it easier to find when the lamp is off and you cannot see.bThere is also a charging port coming out of the backside, saving you an outlet or making your charger more accessible while on your desk. Keep in mind that this is a 1A charger meaning it will charge devices pretty slowly - not a deal breaker if you're charging overnight.bOverall I'm definitely pleased with this lamp and as stated above it has become my new bedside lamp. With variable light modes and settings, a usb port, and adjustable frame, this is sure to be useful for a variety of home or office spaces.This product was provided for review purposes, I have only promised my unbiased and honest opinion.'

It functions very well offering 4 modes with adjustable lighting levels. This light also offers a USB port on the side to charge and sub charged devices. It has two modes a 60 minute mode and an on/off mode as well as 4 different variations when it is on. The 4 variations are sleep, study, reading and relaxing. They each offer different colours to suit type of activity and not stress your eyes. The light is very bright but can be very dim if needed. It is very sturdy and won't be knocked over easily. The light folds in half so it can have less space to take up and also can be rotated and flexed out to get the perfect lighting angle. This light would be perfect for any computer desk to help study or read. Overall this is a great light with very bright LED's, the light hardly takes up space and can charge devices off of it as well as have 4 modes. Overall for the price it is worth it and would easily be a 5/5 but more to a 6/5.Pros:'-Adjustable angle'b-Bright LED's (can be dimmed)-Charges devices off of it'-Compact'-Lightweight'-Different Modes'Suggestions:'-Should have a controller or an app to control the colours or modes remotely to make it easier' ","Reviewed in Canada on July 10, 2016",5,Buynsell, 'Great Lamp'

B00APAQSP6," 'Pros:'1. Bright enough for me.'2. Nice touch controls.'3. Light output (level) adjustability.'4. Some adjustability of color temperature (the modes).'5. USB charging port that is amply powered.'7. Low power usage versus incandescent or halogen.'Cons:'1. Wall wart power supply, but thats not a huge problem really'Overall:'great LED light, another plus for LEDs vs regular fluorescent'Details:'I really like this light. I have the piano black one. It is a very shiny black, much like a piano. It shows dust and fingerprints very well. The base is a 7 square with rounded corners. This light is spec\'ed at 3.3 pounds.There is a rubber/foam pad that covers the entire bottom so it won\'t slide around too much or scratch delicate surfaces. The top surface of the base is not entirely flat.The power cord has a wall wart (100-240V, 50/60Hz) at the end. It is 5 feet long. The connection to the lamp is the traditional round jack connection as opposed to a USB type of jack. The output is 12V at 1.5A. Not 5V like a USB supply would be. Obviously, the output at the USB charging jack is 5V. When first plugged in the default light mode is Reading mode at the middle brightness level (there are 5 levels for each of the 4 color temperature settings). All the other modes also default to the middle level after being plugged in. Controls seem to be capacitive. You do not have to press any switches. Just barely touching the desired control activates it. There is a + and - control to adjust each mode\'s brightness level. You have to tap + or - to go to the next level as opposed to just holding your finger there while it adjusts up or down. Once the lamp is powered it remembers the last light level for each mode when you power off and back on again and it comes on in the mode you last had it in. It does not go to the defaults like it does when initially applying power. It is specified as being 18 tall when the lamp assembly is horizontal to the work surface and the vertical arm is vertical. That is 18 to the top side of the lamp module. It is actually about 17.5 to the bottom side of the lamp (where the LEDs are). There are two rows of 9 bright white LEDs and one row of 9 dimmer, yellower LEDs in the middle for a total of 27 LEDs. The different modes use different combinations and levels of these LEDs. Reading mode is the brightest using all rows. Study is the same except the yellower LED row is just slightly dimmer than in Reading mode. In Relax mode the white LED rows are dimmed to about half of the Reading mode level while the yellow LEDs are at the same level. The sleep mode uses only the yellow LED row at about the same level as the Relax and Reading modes. The brightest setting is plenty bright for me, although that is highly subjective based on your own personal needs. The box rates it at 550 lumens. The LEDs are pretty bright if you look right at them and barely get warm to the touch at their brightest setting. No need to worry about kids touching it. The USB port is a very nice convenience feature and is rated at 1 amp so it charges my phone at the same rate as the factory charger.'

B00APAQSP6," 'bThis is an LED lamp with all the power savings and lifetime you'd expect from a high quality LED but the adjustable color spectrum is pleasantly surprising as it can also appear warm and welcoming instead of cold and efficient, which is what I've been used to with LEDs or most of today's power saving bulbs. I like that this lamp is nice and high and that it includes a charging usb port. At first I thought that the Reading Mode could go a bit brighter, but upon testing with reading material it is exquisitely suitable for reading and study. There is however one major flaw to this lamp, that almost made me return it. The lamp is adjustable any which way, except for the top arm itself where the light is being emitted from. In other words, you can tilt and turn every part of this lamp except for the most critical part, in my opinion. which is the top, that you cannot tilt horizontally away from your eyes (only lower it vertically, which is pretty useless). So if your desk and chair are at a certain height, you will be faced with a light that is glaring into your eyes as you are trying to read or write. This will include many people as this is quite a tall desk lamp. This is annoying to me and a major oversight that a $70+ lamp should not have. It almost made me give up on this lamp. I did however do a quick little DIY and taped a strip of black construction paper to block out the rays hitting my eyes. It did the trick, fortunately! Nevertheless, I think a lamp of this quality and at this price point ought to have a horizontal tilting head or at least an attachable shade of some sorts, to block the light hitting our eyes. Overall, good lamp, but not perfect. If it will last for the 45k hours as advertised (doubtful, to be honest), I'll be old and happy.bUpdate: So after 3 years of daily usage for study, reading and relaxation in my home, I am happy to report that this lamp still works very well. I just checked the display panel and all of the little 27 LED bulbs light up, just as bright as the day I bought it. All of the 4 lighting modes work perfect too. So this lamp is no cheap toy, but a durable and well made tool. I still use it with a strip of black paper to block out the rays from hitting my eyes and I am happy with this solution. At the current price that it goes for (much lower than 3 years ago), I don't think you can go wrong with this lamp.

We tried our first LED desklamp a couple years ago and were quite impressed. They reduce eye strain and provide a pleasant amount of light which seems more natural. LEDs are extremely energy efficient and consume up to 90% less power than incandescent bulbs. Since LEDs use only a fraction of the energy of an incandescent light bulb there is a dramatic decrease in power costs. LED's are durable and generate virtually no heat which is also a huge benefit. Unfortunately, our last one made its way to our daughters dorm at university so we decided to order another for our new home office.We came across this TaoTronics Dimmable LED Desk Lamp which is the same manufacturer as our first LED desktop lamp. This one looked even better and had more features so we decided to order it. Shipping was super fast and it was well packaged. Inside the Amazon shipping box, the unit itself was packed in an attractive box with a convenient handle. Inside contained an easy to read and detailed instruction manual, a power adapter and the lamp unit itself in 2 parts. Putting the lamp together was straight forward...you just place the main unit in the bottom of the base and screw a locking part from underneath which secures the unit to the base.'The first thing we noticed about this was how much more durable it seemed than our last one, and its size. This thing is substantial and has the look and feel of a much more expensive lamp. It adjusts and swivels at every joint which allows it to manuever to whichever position works best at the time or for who is using it. The capacitive touch controls feel rich and worked well but what we found the best feature was the different lighting modes and the light that is produced. It truly is a refreshing and natural light that this unit produces which we found actually eye soothing, yet it is bright enough to do the job well. The USB charging port is also a great feature.'bWe are super happy with this purchase and are considering buying a second so we can take advantage of the lower settings and the auto-shutoff timer by placing it on a bedroom nightstand.

There are brighter (whiter) modes for reading and study - and warmer, more amber tones for relaxing and sleep. And - trust me - you can feel the difference between them. The first two are more energizing, while the relax and sleep modes make you feel like doing exactly that.'bEach of those colours has five brightness levels - allowing you to select precisely what feels right. The LEDs will likely last longer than you will - so it's exceedingly unlikely you'll be replacing them.bOne final feature that's cool: You can fold the lamp down against its vertical stand while turned on. The stand itself has a vertical slit that allows the light to pass through and illuminate the area BEHIND the lamp, providing a subtle backlit glow of indirect light. Very clever.

There are 4 Pre-Set Lighting Modes: Reading Mode, Study Mode, Relax Mode, and Sleep Mode. There is also a brightness control (+ or -) and a 60-minute timer. I found the timer an especially useful feature because sometimes I would come into the room for a little bit and then end up at a different end of the house or find myself leaving with forgetting to turn it off. This way, I had 60 minutes before the lamp would automatically turn off and thus save me money on my power bill. I've also used this feature when I had similar lamps positioned near my bed, because it gives me about 60 minutes of solid reading/tablet browsing time before I know I need to get to bed (would work great for college kids too).bOverall, I have to say this lamp is worth every penny.

Very warm and great to have a light when you lay in bed and relax. There is also a 60 minutes timer that turns the lamp off after 1 hour. This is great for the sleep mode so you don\'t waste any electricity when you don\'t need it. The are also + and - controls which allow you to adjust the brightness manually.'This lamp consists of 27 small LED lights divided into different tones. LED lights are environment friendly and use less energy than incandescent lights. Another great future which I use now on a daily basis is the USB charging port on the side which can charge you phone, tablet or iPod.'As you can read I was quite impressed by the design and functionality of this lamp. I can highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good desk lamp. Big thanks to TaoTronics for providing this lamp for review!'

B00APAQSP6," 'This is an excellent choice for a lamp to use on a desk, by a chair, or on a nightstand, or for a gift that will really be used and appreciated. Because it uses LEDs, it will even pay for itself in a few years in energy savings, compared to a 60 W incandescent.'It is full-size, standing about 18 in. (46 cm) tall when the lower arm is vertical and the upper arm is horizontal. The lamp swivels a full 180 degrees and has two hinges, so it can hover over a book or light the entire desk surface.'The base is weighted for stability and the top surface is slightly indented to hold a smartphone or pens, with a 1 amp USB charging port that is really convenient. It has a glossy finish all over and a microfiber polishing cloth is included, along with nominal 5 ft. (1.5 m) power cable with wall adapter.'The LEDs provide exactly the amount and quality of light needed for activities from watching television to reading or detail work. The touch panel is easy to use and allows control of both the quality and quantity of light through the interplay of eighteen cool white LEDs and nine warm white LEDS. The blend of LEDs is an unusual feature if not a unique one, and it really makes a difference.'There are four main modes that go from dim to bright and warm to white. Each of the four main modes can be further adjusted up or down a couple of steps for precise control over brightness and a total of twenty different settings. There is even a one-hour timer for bedtime reading.'bOverall, I don't know of another light with similar features and quality, and it is handsome, too!TaoTronics provided an Elune for evaluation and review.'

B00APAQSP6," 'bThis lamp has all of the features that I look for in a good desk lamp and some that I'd never thought of. First of all, I love the sleek look and the way it adjusts to so many different positions. You can fold the shade part down against the main arm, so it stands up and down in a straight line when you're not using it. There is also a jointed part just above the touch controls near the base where you can tilt it forward, so you have a lot of options for lighting a large area of your desk. The base is heavy enough that I don't worry about one of the cats knocking it over and if you remove it by unscrewing it from the rest of the lamp it can be stored in a small amount of space. It would be great for use in a student dorm or in an office where it might be moved often.There are actually 27 small LED lights in this lamp. They are lit in different combinations to produce a wide variety of different lighting. One, marked Reading is a bright, daylight type of light that I would describe as cool. This is great for working or reading small print where you need an intense light. The next is one called Study which is a little different tone, not quite as intense, but still pretty bright and a little different color tone. Next there is a Relax light which is a warmer toned light that looks similar to an incandescent bulb, one you might leave on for regular ambient lighting or doing things where you don\'t need a strong light. The next is called Sleep which is more like mood lighting, very soft and warm. This one is nice to use with the 60 minute timer that will turn the light off after an hour. (Great for reading in bed.) In addition to these four different types of light that you can choose, there is also a - and + control where you can adjust any of the 4 levels, making them dimmer or brighter by degrees, just by tapping it, to suit your taste. So it really has more than four lighting levels. These are all touch controls that you just tap to operate and the active one lights up with a tiny red light.'bI like the LED lights because they are low energy and friendlier to the environment. They use about 80 to 90% less energy than an incandescent light. The ones in this lamp are rated to last 45,000 hours. That means that even if you used it for 8 hours every single day, it would last over 15 years! It says it takes 14 watts but when using the softer lights it probably uses even less. Another really nice feature is that it has a USB port near the base where you can plug in your iPhone, iPod or other mp3 player or tablet and charge it while you're working. (Or even after you've turned it off.) This is really handy when you're short on outlets.Taotronics, the manufacturer, really put a lot of thought into the function and design features in this lamp. The quality really shows and it has become a big favorite in our home.' ","Reviewed in Canada on August 5, 2014",5,PT Cruiser," 'A very impressive desk lamp with lots of features and options,' "

Then, when you do press the Power button, you find that it re-starts automatically to the Reading setting, rather than your last-used setting.

B00APAQSP6," 'bThis is a great lamp. What makes it even better is the price for the features that you get. With all the controls placed on a small but adequately sized capacitive touch panel, the lamp comes with four different modes, study, relax, and sleep, and each different mode has a different temperature to it. Study is a very cool white temperature - I find that it indeed does help with setting a study mood. Reading is a little warmer, and this is done by increasing the brightness on some more yellow LED's. I don't do much reading, however, my sister does lots of reading and she prefers to use this lamp over her own. Relax and sleep are of much more yellow/warmer temperatures. I am not the type to prefer such warm temperatures, however, I do find that it is much more easy on the eyes; everything that you do can be categorized into one of their four modes, and it makes whatever you are doing much more enjoyable, easy to do, and easy on the eyes.Not only that but with every mode, you are able to control the brightness of it. Every mode gives you five different brightness levels. Although I would\'ve preferred a smoother gradual increase/decrease of brightness, the five different levels gives more than enough options to really set the perfect brightness for yourself.'The timer feature is something that I do not find myself using as much. This is probably due to the fact that I do not do much reading. However, I can see that this is a great feature for those who read in bed - many people fall asleep with their lamp on, but with such a simple feature built in, the timer will automatically turn the lamp off in 60 minutes. A very simple, yet handy feature for those who would use something like this. Another very interesting feature of the lamp is the built-in USB port, this will allow you to charge your phone through the lamp. This, in combination with the timer feature, makes it an excellent bedside lamp.'bThe one complaint I have the build quality of the lamp, which is why I have to give this lamp four stars instead of five. The vertical stand/arm for the lamp seems to be flimsy at times, thus creating a little bit of space for the arm to wobble around, especially when you bend the arms to re-position the light direction and placement. Not only that, but the entire lamp seems to be made of slightly sub-par plastic. Asking for a metal build would be way too much, but asking for slightly better plastic won't hurt. The base of the lamp is heavy enough, however, to keep the entire lamp planted on your desk.bOverall, an excellent lamp, especially for the price.

The cord plugs into the back of the lamp instead of being attached internally. The other end is a wall wort style plug which makes it a pain to find space for.'The biggest drawback is the length. It is about 3-3.5 feet long so unless you have a free plug right where you want the lamp you will be looking for an extension cord. I have never seen a lamp with a cord this short before so I reduced the rating to 3 stars.' ","Reviewed in Canada on January 18, 2017",1,Eric, 'Avoid due to review vote manipulation practises'
